# movie-review-sentiment-analysis
My very first NTPL project I worked on, I used Kaggle to get the Dataset for this project. This project is pretty simple, I set up a machine that would go through movie reviews that were collected in the Dataset and output the sentiment of each review, whether it is positive or negative.
