# movie-review-sentiment-analysis
My very first NTPL project I worked on, I used Kaggle to get the Dataset for this project and used the websote's notebook to make this. This project is pretty simple, I set up a machine that would go through movie reviews that were collected in the Dataset and output the sentiment of each review, whether it is positive or negative.

I wrote comments explaining the steps of each code block. There was an error in the nltk code block to help the machine with treating simmilar words the same. Example: Amazing, amazing.
The error is server sided so I couldn't really do much about it besides putting in a fix where it would install nltk locally within the notebook session.

Other than that everything should be good and zero nulls in the Dataset.
